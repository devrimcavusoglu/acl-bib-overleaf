# ACL Bibliography Files for Overleaf

Overleaf supports uploading up to 50 MB per file, however currently the bib file [anthology.bib](http://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib) exceeds 50 MB. Thus, to easily use the bib file on overleaf this repository provides split files each < 50 MB.

**TL;DR.** https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files/issues/25

Find the split bib files under [releases](https://github.com/devrimcavusoglu/acl-bib-overleaf/releases).
